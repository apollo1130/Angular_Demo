Hi. Matt.
So sorry. I have some payment issues on my side.
If I accept that job, I lose verify payment because of Fee.
So Could you please post a new hourly job for me?
I will track the time based on your agreement. If you don't satisfy the work result, you can refuse release payment.
So I think we can go through an hourly contract.
How about my suggestion?
